I tested only autocorrelating every 10, 100, and 1000 lagsteps. Sampling infrequently gave noisy Green Kubo integrals with unreliable results. 

The early lagsteps are vital to correctly calculating the GK integral. 

It may be worthwhile in the future looking into finding all the early lagsteps, but then only a portion of the later lagsteps (like every 10 or 100 of any lagsteps past 50%)
